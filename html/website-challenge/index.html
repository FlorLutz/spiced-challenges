    <h2 id="what">What we do?</h2>
    <p>Gravel XP offers gravel bike trainings session from 2-4 hours for beginner or intermediate riders - all ages, all genders welcome!</p>
    <h2 id="how">How we do it?</h2>
    <p>We meet up with several riders or a whole group and get right to it. Riding bikes can only be learned riding bikes. üòÅ After a short intro we put it in practice as long as we all master the skill. There are lots of hints and tricks from our experienced teachers.</p>
    <h2 id="why">Why should you be a part of it?</h2>
    <p>There are so many reasons to go for a ride with us. We'll jst name a few:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You recently hopped on the gravel train, love riding bikes, but just don't know how to start riding offroad.</li>
            <li>You would like to see what else is there to do with a wide tire bike like yours and get bored of the daily urban tarmc.</li>
            <li>Thinking about getting a gravel bike for yourself, but just wanna really try out this kind of ride in its natural environment.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2 id="where">Where is it taking place?</h2>
    <p> Exact details follow few days before the individual rides. We offer trainings at the following locations:
        <ul>
            <li>Tempelhofer Feld</li>
            <li>Grunewald</li>
            <li>Pl√§nterwald</li>
            <li>Tiergarten</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2 id="whatBike">What bike should I have?</h2>
    <p>Any kind of gravel-bike will be welcome. Important for the skill training is a dropbar. Either pedal-system - flat or clipless - are fine. Handling will vary. Also, don't worry about mudguards or how fresh and shiny your ride is. It's about our skills not looks üëå</p>
